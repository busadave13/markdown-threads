## 0.2.0 — Orphaned Thread Support & Reparenting

- **Bug fix: Orphaned comment threads now displayed** — When a markdown section is deleted, its comment threads now appear in a dedicated "Orphaned Comments" section at the bottom of the sidebar with a "⚠ Section Removed" indicator. Users can still resolve or delete orphaned threads. The statistics chart now includes an "Orphaned" category. (Fixes #6)
- **Reparent orphaned threads** — When a heading is renamed (changing its slug), orphaned threads can now be reparented. If the thread's original line number or content hash matches an existing section, a "🔗 Reparent to: [Section Name]" button appears for one-click reparenting. Otherwise, a dropdown allows manual selection of the target section.
- **UI improvements** — Sidebar header changed from "Comments" to "Threads" with thread count badge. Heading badges in preview now show thread count (e.g., "2 threads") with tooltip showing full comment count.
