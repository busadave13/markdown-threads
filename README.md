# Markdown Review

Add threaded review comments to any markdown file in your Git repository — right from VS Code. Comments are stored as sidecar JSON files alongside your docs, and can be published as pull requests to GitHub or Azure DevOps with one click.

## Features

- **Preview sidebar** — Right-click any `.md` file → "Markdown: Review and Comment" to open a rendered preview with an inline comment sidebar
- **Threaded comments** — Add, reply to, edit, and delete comments anchored to markdown sections
- **Reactions** — Thumbs-up reactions on individual comments
- **Resolve / Reopen** — Mark threads as resolved; resolved threads lock further edits
- **Stale detection** — Comments are flagged when the underlying section content changes
- **Statistics chart** — See open vs resolved thread counts at a glance
- **Draft mode** — Comments are saved locally as drafts until you publish
- **One-click PR creation** — Publish all draft comments as a pull request to GitHub or Azure DevOps

## How It Works

1. Right-click any `.md` file in the Explorer → **"Markdown: Review and Comment"**
2. The preview panel opens beside your editor with a comment sidebar
3. Click **Add Comment** on any section heading to start a thread
4. When ready, click the **Publish** button in the sidebar header, or run **"Publish Pending Comments as PR"** from the command palette

The publish button appears automatically in the comment sidebar when you have draft comments, showing the count (e.g. "Publish 3 drafts"). It is hidden when there are no drafts to publish.

Comments are stored in a `.comments.json` sidecar file next to each document:

```
docs/
  feature-x.md
  feature-x.comments.json    ← created automatically
```

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `markdownReview.autoOpenPR` | `true` | Open browser to PR after creation |
| `markdownReview.branchPrefix` | `"doc-comment"` | Prefix for comment branches |
| `markdownReview.defaultProvider` | `"auto"` | Git provider (`auto`, `github`, `azuredevops`) |

## Anchoring

Comments anchor to markdown sections using a hybrid of heading slug, content hash, and line hint. When the content under a heading changes, the comment is flagged as **stale** rather than lost.

- VS Code 1.85.0+
